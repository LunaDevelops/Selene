# âœ¨ğŸŒ™ Your Celestial Guardian, Selene! ğŸŒ™âœ¨
Selene is a discord bot that I have created to use for my personal server, to enhance my members' experience and make my server a haven for friendships to blossom.
<br /><br />

# ğŸŒ‘ Selene's Commands ğŸŒ‘
## 1. `/help`
This command provides the user will all of Selene's commands, and how they can be used.
<br /><br />

## 2. `/create`
### `/create ticket`: Lets members report other users that violate the rules of my server.
### `/create report`: Lets members create a feedback / bug report.
<br /><br />

## 3. `/set`
### `/set creator`: This allows my Cosmic Creators to set their personal creator link (link to their media's) so Selene can alert the Celestial Cartographers.
<br /><br />

# ğŸŒŸ Contributions ğŸŒŸ
Since Selene is open source, I am very limited on how you can contribute. If you'd like, you may fork and make a pull request and add new features or enhancements that you see fit. Your input is always welcome !!
<br /><br />

# ğŸŒŒ Contact ğŸŒŒ
If you have any questions, or you see any ways a user can abuse my bot, you can reach out to me directly through discord or email.
